    We bring to you the freshest Coffee seeds sourced from the best
    plantations in India. Our Coffee seeds are vacuum packed immediately after
    manufacturing at the garden itself to give you the freshest glass of Chai.
    <br />
    Staying true to our Clean Earth practices, our Coffees are packed in
    pouches that are 100% biodegradable. A custom designed steel scoop is
    placed in each pouch to make sure that every scoop has just the desired
    amount of Coffee in it.
    <br />
    Our endeavor is to become a part of the Chai ritual in your home everyday!

  <h2>French Roast</h2>
  <img src="./images/coffee blend.jpeg" alt="house blend" />
  <p style="width: 50%;">
    Coffee Thomas, one of the city's premier coffee roasters, occupies the
    ground floor of a modern building designed for social housing in a
    developing section of the eighteenth arrondissement.
    <br />
    Inside, though, it's all high-design exposed stone walls, reclaimed wood
    tables, and vintage chairs. The calming environment attracts young
    professionals and students.
    <br />
    But since the roasting facility and training/tasting room are on-site,
    you're also likely to cross paths with coffee distributors and industry
    folk.

  <h2>Columbian Coffee</h2>
  <img src="./images/learn.jpeg" alt="house blend" />
  <p style="width: 50%;">
    It's impossible to miss the light fixtures fashioned like clouds above
    blonde wood tables. Or the walls, dressed up with thought-provoking works
    by rotating artists and photographers. <br />This relaxing environment
    trumps most Parisian coffee shops and the locals, frequently found reading
    or writing, know it.<br />
    The owner is an expert in specialty coffeeâ€”he photographed an entire book
    on the third wave coffee movement in Coffee Thomas. <br />
    Not to mention the staff is largely Scandinavian; they take orders
    promptly and hustle to serve everyone quickly.
