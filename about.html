    <h1>About Us</h1>
    <br />
    <p>
      Coffee Thomas, a part of Coffee Day Global Limited, is India’s favourite
      hangout for coffee and conversations. Popularly known as CT, we strive to
      provide the best experience to our guests. Our coffees are sourced from
      thousands of small coffee planters, who made us who we are today and we're
      glad to be a part of their lives. We opened our first cafe in 1996 at
      Brigade Road in Bangalore – the youth and the young at heart immediately
      took to the cafe, and it continues to be one of the most happening places
      in the city. CT to the youth is a “hangout” spot where they meet people,
      make conversations, and have a whole lot of fun over steaming cups of
      great coffee.It's been an exciting journey since then to becoming the
      largest organised retail cafe chain in the country. We’re also present in
      Austria, Czech Republic and Malaysia, so if your travel takes you there,
      do stop by our outlets to get a taste from back home!
